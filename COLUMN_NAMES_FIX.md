# Database Column Name Fix

## The Problem

The issue was that the column names in your Supabase database table `course_content` have spaces and capital letters (like "Content Type"), but the code was trying to access them with lowercase and underscores (like "content_type").

## What Was Fixed

I've updated all references to column names in `courseContentService.ts` to match exactly how they appear in your Supabase database:

1. Changed `content_type` to `"Content Type"`
2. Changed `media_url` to `"Media URL"`
3. Changed `file_size` to `"File Size"`
4. Changed `is_published` to `"Is Published"`

## Why This Works

In JavaScript/TypeScript, when an object property has spaces or special characters, you need to access it with bracket notation and quotes:

```javascript
// Instead of this:
item.content_type

// We need to use this:
item["Content Type"]
```

## What This Should Fix

This change should allow:
1. Course content to be successfully saved to the database
2. Content to persist after page refreshes
3. The error about missing the "content_type" column to be resolved

## Next Steps

After trying these changes:

1. Test adding new content to make sure it works properly
2. Refresh the page to see if content persists
3. Check the database in Supabase to confirm data is being saved

If you continue to have issues, it might be helpful to get a screenshot or export of your exact database schema so we can make further adjustments.
