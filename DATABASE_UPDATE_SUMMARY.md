# Database Schema Update Summary

## Issues Fixed

We identified and fixed several issues related to course persistence in the database:

1. **Table Name Case Sensitivity**: The table name in Supabase is case-sensitive and was named `Courses` (capitalized) rather than `courses` (lowercase) as was being used in the code.

2. **Column Name Inconsistency**: The column names in Supabase include spaces and capital letters, such as `Course Title`, `Description`, and `Instructor`, which were being accessed incorrectly in the code.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Code Files

- **courseService.ts**: 
  - Fixed table references from 'courses' to 'Courses'
  - Updated column names to match database schema (`title` â†’ `Course Title`, etc.)
  - Improved the updateCourse function to handle all fields properly

- **supabaseClient.ts**:
  - Moved type definitions to a centralized location
  - Updated the Course type to match actual database column names

### 2. Added Documentation

- **DATABASE_SCHEMA.md**: 
  - Created comprehensive documentation of all table and column names
  - Included naming conventions and best practices for working with the database

- **Updated README.md**:
  - Added section about database naming conventions
  - Added references to new documentation and setup files

### 3. Added Database Setup Tools

- **fix-table-capitalization.sql**: 
  - Created SQL script to ensure database tables have the correct structure
  - Added statements for proper column names in tables
  - Included migration statements for moving data if needed (commented out for safety)

### 4. Created Centralized Types

- **src/types/CourseTypes.ts**:
  - Added properly defined TypeScript interfaces that match exact database column names
  - Provides a single source of truth for type definitions across the application

## Benefits of These Changes

1. **Consistency**: All code now uses the exact database column names
2. **Documentation**: New developers can easily understand the database structure
3. **Type Safety**: TypeScript interfaces match database column names exactly
4. **Migration Path**: SQL script provides a way to fix or create tables with proper structure

## Next Steps

1. Test all course creation, editing, and listing functionality
2. Consider running the migration script if there are existing tables with incorrect names
3. Ensure all other components use the centralized type definitions
4. Standardize database column naming in future table creation
